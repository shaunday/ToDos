# This is one of potentially many script files in a directory.
# All files in the selected directory will be launched concurrently as separate simulations.
#
# Usage:
#   Place multiple .txt files with different scripts in the same folder.
#   The orchestrator will launch a simulator for each file in the folder at the same time.

# Example simulation script for ToDos.Clients.Simulator
# Format: operation1,operation2,...,count,delayEach,delayEnd
# Optional headers:
#   userId=123           # sets the user ID for the simulation
#   signToEvents=true    # if true, subscribes to task events and logs them
#   numOfClients=5       # number of concurrent simulator instances to launch
